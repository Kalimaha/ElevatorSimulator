# Elevator Simulator
The elevator Simulator is an Elevator system with a web frontend and backend storage system.
* The gui should cater for 4 elevators (_numbered A,B,C and D_) and 10 floors.
* Each elevator should not take on more than 20 people at a time.
* People on a certain floor (_for example, Level 9_) should get the nearest available elevator (_eg, say 3 elevators {A,B,C} are on floor 1 and the fourth {D} is on level 10 then elevator D should travel to get the people on level 9_)
* The gui should show each level and the number of people who wish to enter an elevator (_textbox_)
* Each level should have dropdown menu and button beside it to represent the level / floor that the people on the said level wish to travel to
* On each level there should be another 4 columns which show each elevator status. That is, the number of people in the current elevator and whether itâ€™s going up (^) down (\/) or stationary (-)
